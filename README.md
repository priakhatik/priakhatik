## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Data Analytics Engineer** with 5+ years of experience building scalable data pipelines, analytics solutions, and business intelligence systems that turn raw data into actionable insights.

Currently pursuing my **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence & Business Analytics at the University of South Florida**, I combine strong foundations in data engineering, data warehousing, and advanced analytics with real-world industry experience.

At **Sarasota County Government**, I analyze fleet operations for 1,000+ vehicles, supporting a **$12M+ replacement budget** through SQL-driven analysis, data modeling, and Power BI dashboards that directly influence operational and financial decisions.

Previously at **Accenture**, I partnered with product and analytics teams to design and optimize **ETL pipelines using Python and SQL** across **GCP and Snowflake**, built **star and snowflake schemas**, and delivered BI solutions that improved data freshness, reporting efficiency, and decision-making speed at scale.

My work spans **data pipelines, dimensional modeling, analytics engineering, and BI**, with a strong focus on data quality, scalability, and measurable business impact.
